# Module 9B - Custom Profile Component

## Description
This is a React app built with Vite. It contains a profile component styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to use JSX
- How to style with inline CSS
- How to create and render functional components
- How to use props and useState

## Challenges
The only issue I ran into with this assignment was with a typo when I was adding my second component rendered my app as a blank page. I quicklu figured it out though, I had just made an error when statically entering the user's vitals data.
